# Copilot Instructions for babblr

## Project Overview
babblr is a Duolingo successor designed to help users learn foreign languages in a conversational way with adaptive difficulty. The project aims to provide an engaging, interactive language learning experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Project Type**: Language learning application with conversational AI capabilities

## Code Style and Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use type hints where appropriate to improve code clarity
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Project Structure
This is an early-stage project. As the codebase grows, maintain a clear separation of concerns:
- Keep language learning logic separate from UI/presentation
- Organize code by feature/module
- Use meaningful directory names that reflect their purpose

## Dependencies and Environment
- Python virtual environments are used (see `.gitignore` for common patterns)
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented
- Document any environment variables or configuration needs

## Development Workflow
- Make incremental, focused changes
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Write clear commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes
- Consider the user experience when implementing new features

## Language Learning Specific Guidelines
- Design features with adaptive difficulty in mind
- Focus on conversational and interactive learning approaches
- Consider various language learning methodologies (immersion, spaced repetition, etc.)
- Keep the user experience engaging and motivating

## Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass before submitting changes
- Test edge cases, especially for language processing logic

## Documentation
- Update README.md when adding major features
- Document complex algorithms or unusual approaches
- Keep inline comments focused on "why" rather than "what"
