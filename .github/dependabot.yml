# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Review Strategy:
# - Maximum simplification: ONE PR per ecosystem weekly (3 PRs total)
# - All backend updates → 1 PR on Monday 03:00 UTC
# - All frontend updates → 1 PR on Monday 03:00 UTC
# - All GitHub Actions updates → 1 PR on Monday 03:00 UTC
# - Updates reviewed and manually merged with attribution to @pkuppens
# - Failed/problematic updates are deferred and tracked in CHANGELOG.md
