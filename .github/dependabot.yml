# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Review Strategy:
# - All dependency updates are reviewed by @pkuppens before merging
# - Updates are evaluated for: breaking changes, security implications, test compatibility
# - Timing of merges is coordinated with development cycles
# - Failed/problematic updates are deferred and tracked in CHANGELOG.md
