# Babblr Commercial License (Overview)

This file describes the intent of Babblr commercial licensing and how to request it.
The binding commercial terms are provided separately during the licensing process.

## What this is for

Babblr is available under **AGPL-3.0** for open-source use. If you want to use Babblr in a way that is **not compatible with AGPL** (for example, proprietary / closed-source distribution or services), you can request a **commercial license**.

## Typical cases that require a commercial license

- Shipping Babblr (or modified Babblr) inside a proprietary / closed-source product
- Offering Babblr as a hosted service without providing source code to users as required by AGPL
- Embedding Babblr into a larger proprietary system where AGPL obligations cannot be met

## How to request commercial licensing

Please contact the maintainer:

- Open a GitHub issue titled **"Commercial license request"** and tag `@pkuppens`

If you cannot open a public issue, you can request a private contact channel via GitHub.

## Non-legal notice

This document is not legal advice and does not grant rights by itself. For open-source terms, see `LICENSE` and `LICENSING.md`.
