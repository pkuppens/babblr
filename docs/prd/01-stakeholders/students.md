## Motivating Lessons

### What Makes a Lesson Motivating?

Based on student needs and SLA research:

#### 1. Real-World Relevance
**Examples**:
- ✅ "Negotiating a contract in Spanish"
- ✅ "Ordering at a French restaurant"
- ❌ "The cat is on the table"

**Why**: Students want to use language for real purposes, not abstract exercises.

---

#### 2. Immediate Feedback
**Examples**:
- ✅ "You said 'yo soy hambre' but it should be 'tengo hambre.' In Spanish, hunger is something you 'have,' not something you 'are.'"
- ❌ [No feedback, or just marks error red]

**Why**: Learners need to understand *why* something is wrong to improve.

---

#### 3. Appropriate Difficulty (i+1)
**Examples**:
- ✅ A2 learner: "I like travel. I go Italy next month." → AI introduces past tense naturally
- ❌ A2 learner thrown into C1 business negotiations

**Why**: Too easy is boring, too hard is frustrating. Optimal learning at edge of ability.

---

#### 4. Practical Scenarios
**Examples**:
- ✅ "You're checking into a hotel in Germany"
- ✅ "You're calling a client in Spain"
- ❌ Random sentences with no context

**Why**: Task-based learning (TBLT) more effective than decontextualized drills.

---

#### 5. Respect for Learner's Time
**Examples**:
- ✅ 15-minute conversation covers useful vocabulary and grammar
- ❌ Hour-long lesson covering trivial content

**Why**: Adult learners have limited time; every minute should be valuable.

---

#### 6. Positive Reinforcement
**Examples**:
- ✅ "Great use of the subjunctive there! Your grammar is improving."
- ✅ "You're getting much better at rolling your Rs."
- ❌ Silent or only corrects errors

**Why**: Motivation, confidence building, growth mindset.
