# Language Learning Context

## Purpose

Explains the pedagogical approach and research basis for Babblr.

## Learning Philosophy

### Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)
- Focus on meaningful communication
- Real-world tasks over drills
- Fluency and accuracy balanced

### Comprehensible Input (Krashen's i+1)
- Learning occurs when exposed to language slightly above current level
- CEFR levels implement this principle

### Error Correction Strategy
- Gentle, explanatory corrections
- Focus on meaning first, accuracy second
- Positive reinforcement

## Research Basis

- Krashen, S. (1982). Principles and Practice in Second Language Acquisition
- Swain, M. (1985). Communicative competence: Some roles of comprehensible input and comprehensible output
- Ellis, R. (2003). Task-based Language Learning and Teaching

## Implementation in Babblr
