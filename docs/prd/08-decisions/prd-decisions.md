## Decision Framework

When making decisions, we ask:
1. **Mission Alignment**: Does this help learners practice natural conversation?
2. **User Impact**: Does this address real pain points?
3. **Evidence**: Is this grounded in research or validated feedback?
4. **Sustainability**: Does this support long-term viability?
5. **Privacy**: Does this respect user privacy?
