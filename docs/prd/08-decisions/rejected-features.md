## Rejected Features

### Social Learning / Peer-to-Peer Practice
**Rejected**: 2026-02-02

**Rationale**:

- Better served by existing platforms (iTalki, Tandem)

**Revisit If**: Strong user demand AND clear differentiation from existing solutions

### Cloud Sync Across Devices
**Rejected**: 2026-02-02

**Rationale**:
- Violates privacy-first principle (requires cloud account)
- Adds infrastructure costs
- Manual export/import acceptable workaround

**Revisit If**: User demand AND can implement with end-to-end encryption, optional

### Gamification (Streaks, Points, Leaderboards)
**Rejected**: 2026-02-02

**Rationale**:
- Research shows extrinsic motivation less effective
- Violates "natural conversation over gamification" principle
- Childish UX not aligned with target users (adults)

**Revisit If**: Research shows gamification effective for specific segments (unlikely)

### Subscription Model (vs. BYOAPI)
**Rejected**: 2026-02-02
