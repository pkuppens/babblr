## When AGPL-3.0 is enough

You can use Babblr under **AGPL-3.0** if you can comply with its requirements.

## When you need a commercial license

You need a **commercial license** if you want to:

- Use Babblr in a proprietary / closed-source product, or
- Offer Babblr as a service without meeting AGPL source-sharing requirements, or
- Distribute Babblr as part of a closed-source desktop application where you cannot comply with AGPL obligations
